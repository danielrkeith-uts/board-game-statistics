# Board Game Statistics
Project for 41026 Advanced Software Development

## Running project locally
The project will only run as intended when both the frontend and backend are running

### Running backend locally
1. Navigate to `board-game-statistics-api`
2. Run `mvn package`
3. Run `java -jar target/*.jar`

This will run the backend on port 8080

### Running frontend locally
1. Navigate to `board-game-statistics`
2. Run `npm install` *(Only needs to be done once)*
3. Run `npm dev`

This will run the frontend on port 3000
