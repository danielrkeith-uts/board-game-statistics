```

2. To run the frontend, run the following command:
```
npm run dev
```

## Currently installed dependencies
The following dependency packages are used in this repository:
- React
- React-router-DOM
- SCSS
- Bootstrap

### Using SCSS

This will automatically compile the scss file to a css file, which is necessary for the styles to apply.
